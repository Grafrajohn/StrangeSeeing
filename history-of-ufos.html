Science currently says that the Universe is 13.8 billion years old and the Earth is 4.6 billion years old. We now know also that planets are quite common around stars. So given the vastness of the Universe, there may potentially be many millions of worlds which were in existence for billions of years before earth formed.</p><br><p>We also now know that some planets are in the inhabitable zone which could support life – not too near to their star (unlike Mercury and Venus) and not too far away (unlike Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto). As evolution on Earth shows us that natural selection produces generations of ever more intelligent animals, we can assume that this evolutionary dynamic may well operate on other worlds too. Hence it is quite possible that there are intelligent beings on other worlds and that they evolved billions of years before Earth was created.</p><br><p>Human science and technology has advanced steadily in the 200,000 years since Homo Sapiens first appeared on Earth. Imagine how far advanced would be the technology of a civilisation which began on a faraway world several billion years before earth was formed. If it is possible to traverse the great distances in space, they may well have found it several billion years ago.</p><br><p>Therefore if aliens exist it is quite possible that they know more about us than we do.</p><br><br><h2>Ancient evidence of UFOs and aliens</h2><br><p>NASA, the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is an organisation which rarely talks about UFOs and aliens. Astonishingly there is a PDF on their site, written in 2007 by a former member of staff, R. Stothers, which describes ancient UFO sightings. I have attached the full PDF here. Broadly the text concludes that UFOs fascinated the ancients and still fascinate us today, for many of the same reasons.</p><br><br><h2>Prehistoric Art</h2><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtebvnzsp/image/upload/v1537903623/8af63f69891794531116bc858c35ae22.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Prehistoric cave painting of alien?"><br><br><p>This extraordinary image is a Wandjina spirit painting Petroglyph from Kimberly, Australia. It has been dated at approximately 3000 BC. The figures painted closely resemble the descriptions of entities reported by people who claim to have glimpsed strange creatures near landed UFOs, or who claim to have been abducted into UFOs. Of course the resemblance could be a coincidence, but it is a striking coincidence that aboriginal Australian people, who at that time had never seen Europeans with lighter skin, should paint these light-skinned figures with large dark eyes.</p><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtebvnzsp/image/upload/v1537903624/1350178.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Prehistoric painting of alien?"><br><br><br><p>This image was painted in China 47,000 years ago.</p><br><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtebvnzsp/image/upload/v1537903623/7f6b2a4c65d8386dd3b66142b0f4659b.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Prehistoric painting of alien?"><br><br><p>Finally here is another prehistoric cave painting. I am still researching the age and location of this one. Notice the strange disc shaped and cigar shaped objects to the right of the figure, which resembles a humanoid in a hazard or space suit.</p><br><br><h2>Ancient Art and Writings</h2><br><p></p>Ancient civilisations developed not just art, but also writing, and this enabled may recordings of phenomena which would today be called UFOs.<p></p><br><br><h2>Josephus</h2><br><p>The historian Josephus in approximately 65 A.D. wrote of a sighting over the ancient region of Judea. The sighting described ‘miraculous’ chariots in the sky and what seemed to him to be ‘battalions’ in the sky. Of course at this time Josephus and his contemporaries would have had no framework to be able to describe what they saw. It would be nearly 2,000 years before the first aircraft, balloon or (human) spacecraft.</p><br><br><p>Often ancient accounts speak of ‘glowing shields’ which is pretty much what many UFOs look like, since many ancient shields were round and flat with a protruding dome in the middle.</p><br><br><h2>Medieval and Renaissance Art and Writings</h2><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtebvnzsp/image/upload/v1537903623/862d588af8a46b78ce00ca57ff4ca82e-2.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="UFO in renaissance painting"><br><br><p>“The Madonna with Saint Giovannino”, above, is a painting by the 15th century artist Domenico. It shows what appears to be a UFO on the sky behind Mary.</p><br><br><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtebvnzsp/image/upload/v1537903624/transmiss05.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="UFO in medieval painting"><br><br><p>This fresco painted in 1350 depicts “The Crucifixion” in the Visoki Decani Monestary in Kosovo, Serbia. There are two UFO-like objects, one either side of Jesus.</p><br><br><p>If we are being visited, there is no reason to assume, given the great age of the universe, that the visits began recently. They may have begun thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of years ago.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgrafrajohn.github.io%2FStrangeSeeing%2Fhistory-of-ufos.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://grafrajohn.github.io/StrangeSeeing/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://grafrajohn.github.io/StrangeSeeing/media/website/Picture-3.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Graham"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://grafrajohn.github.io/StrangeSeeing/authors/graham/" class="invert" rel="author">Graham</a></h3><p>Interested in UFOs since my teenage years.
