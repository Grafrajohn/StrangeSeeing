<p>It may be that the history of UFOs pre-dates our own history. Science currently says that the Universe is 13.8 billion years old and the Earth is 4.6 billion years old. We now know also that planets are quite common around stars. So given the vastness of the Universe, there may potentially be many millions of worlds which were in existence for billions of years before earth formed.</p>
<p>We also now know that some planets are in the inhabitable zone which could support life â€“ not too near to their star (unlike Mercury and Venus) and not too far away (unlike Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto). As evolution on Earth shows us that natural selection produces generations of ever more intelligent animals, we can assume that this evolutionary dynamic may well operate on other worlds too. Hence it is quite possible that there are intelligent beings on other worlds and that they evolved billions of years before Earth was created.</p>
<p>Human science and technology has advanced steadily in the 200,000 years since Homo Sapiens first appeared on Earth. Imagine how far advanced would be the technology of a civilisation which began on a faraway world several billion years before earth was formed. If it is possible to traverse the great distances in space, they may well have found it several billion years ago.</p>
