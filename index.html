                <h1>A rational look at UFOs</h1>
                <p>This site is intended as a rational person’s guide to the fascinating phenomena of UFOs and aliens.</p>
                <p>‘UFOs’ are defined here as any unidentified flying object or unexplained aerial phenomena. ‘Aliens’ are the presumed manufacturers and pilots of these objects or creators of the phenomena.</p>
                <p>Perhaps not all ‘UFOs’ are piloted by aliens, but it may be that at least some are. An ‘alien’ could conceivably come from another part of the universe, another dimension or another time. Increasingly it seems that some ‘UFOs’ may actually only be unidentified to the general public but positively identified to the military organisations which secretly created them.</p>
                <p>It should always be remembered that approximately 98% of all unidentified and aerial phenomena can be rationally explained. The 2% which remain unexplained are what we are interested in.</p>
